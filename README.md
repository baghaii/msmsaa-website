MSMSAA Website
--------------

These are the files used to create the website of the Mississippi
School for Mathematics and Science Alumni Association.  The files used
to create the website will be in a \_site directory.  These files
use Bootstrap classes to be more mobile friendly.  

The files used to generate \_site are in the \_source directory.
The files in \_source are processed using Jekyll to build the \_site 
directory.  Jekyll knows to use \_source to build \_site because of
the information in \_config.yml.

Changes to the website should be made in \_site so they are not lost
in future revisions.
