			<p>Alumni who still live in the state of Mississippi can help

							<p><i>This Section Adapted from the Mississippi 
							Blue Book</i></p>

							<p><b>Drafting and Introduction.</b> A bill 
							must first be drafted in paper form. Legislative 
							research and drafting offices are operated on a 
							year-round basis in both the House and the Senate 
							to assist the members with the necessary research 
							and legal work involved in drafting bills in 
							correct form. Since the advent of annual sessions, 
							a system of pre-filing has been instituted in both 
							Houses. This means that bills may be written and 
							introduced on an unofficial basis in the interim 
							between sessions. For all practical purposes, the 
							pre-filed bills are treated in the same manner as 
							bills introduced when the Legislature is actually 
							in session. At the time a member signifies that a 
							bill is to be filed, it is placed on the 
							Speaker's/President's desk for referral to 
							Committee and, after referral, is given a number 
							which it will retain throughout the legislative 
							process. When the session convenes, the pre-filed 
							bills are introduced officially into the records. 
							Bills introduced after the session convenes are 
							dropped into the "hopper" at the 
							Clerk's/Secretary's desk. Bills must be 
							typewritten on legal-sized paper, doublespaced, 
							with the title and name of author or authors on 
							the outside and must be introduced in original 
							form.</p>

							<p><b>Referred to Committee.</b> Each bill is 
							referred to one or more of the standing committees 
							in the House or Senate for study and 
							recommendation. In the regular order of business, 
							the bills are read by title and number, and the 
							committee to which it has been referred is 
							announced. All bills are listed on a daily 
							introduction list, entered in the bill docket and 
							committee books, and copies are reproduced. The 
							bill itself is placed in a jacket and put into 
							the committee box.</p>

							<p><b>Reported by Committee.</b> The committee 
							to which a bill has been referred reports its 
							recommendations to the House or Senate. It may 
							report the bill "Do Pass," "Do Pass As Amended," 
							"Committee Substitute Do Pass," or it may report 
							the bill "Do Not Pass," which has the effect of 
							killing the bill unless a Minority Report is 
							filed within three days by one or more of the 
							members of the committee who were present at the 
							meeting at which the bill was reported. If a bill 
							has not been reported by a committee after 
							reference, a motion to withdraw the bill may be 
							filed. When a bill has been reported favorably by 
							a committee, it is placed on the calendar for 
							House or Senate action. Separate divisions of the 
							calendar are kept for bills reported by the 
							appropriations, revenue, and local and private 
							committees. Appropriations and Revenue bills have 
							precedence over bills on the General Calendar. 
							The Legislature operates under a system of 
							deadlines which sets the limits of time in which 
							bills may be introduced, reported from Committee, 
							acted upon originally in each House, amendments 
							considered from the other House, and Conference 
							Reports adopted. The deadlines are for the purpose 
							of assuring an orderly flow of legislative action 
							within the 90-day constitutional limitation of 
							sessions. The first session of each administration 
							has a limitation of 125 days, and the deadlines 
							are adjusted for the additional time.  </p>

							<p><b>Consideration by House/Senate.</b> When a 
							bill comes up in its regular order on the calendar,
							it is usually called up and handled on the chamber 
							floor by the Chairman of the Committee to which it 
							has been referred. The bill is read and debated by 
							the House or Senate, and, at this time, amendments 
							may be proposed and either adopted or rejected. 
							Other possible actions may be taken at this time â€” 
							the bill may be recommitted to the committee for 
							further study; it may be laid on the table, subject
							to call; it may be set for special order; or 
							postponed to another date for action. An amendment 
							to strike all after the enacting clause, if 
							adopted, would kill the bill, or if a motion 
							carried to indefinitely postpone the bill, it would
							be dead.</p>

							<p><b>The Vote.</b> A quorum must be present 
							for the vote on the final passage of any measure. 
							Bills of a general nature require a majority of 
							those present and voting for passage; appropriation
							bills require a majority of the elected membership;
							revenue bills require a three-fifths majority of 
							those present and voting; bills restoring suffrage 
							or bills granting a donation or gratuity to any 
							person require two-thirds of the elected 
							membership. Adoption of Conference Reports or 
							concurrence in Senate or House amendments require 
							the same vote as was required for the original 
							passage of the bill. After passage of a bill, it 
							is subject to reconsideration for one whole 
							legislative day. After the time has passed for 
							reconsideration, any amendments that were adopted 
							are engrossed into the bill, which is then sent to 
							the other House.</p>

							<p><b>House/Senate Action.</b> When a bill reaches 
							the other House, it goes through the same process 
							of referral to Committee, report by Committee, and 
							floor action. If a bill passes the other House 
							without amendment, it is returned to the House of 
							origin, enrolled, signed by the Speaker and the 
							Lieutenant Governor, and presented to the Governor.
							If the other House adopts amendments to the bill, 
							the bill and the accompanying amendments are 
							returned to the House of origin, and the bill is 
							placed on the calendar for concurrence or 
							non-concurrence in the amendments of the other 
							House. Should one House concur, the other is 
							notified, the bill is engrossed, enrolled, and 
							presented to the Governor. If one House declines to
							concur in the amendments of the other, it may 
							request a conference to work out the differences 
							between the two Houses. A conference committee is 
							composed of three members from each House, and if 
							the report of the conference committee is adopted 
							by both Houses, the bill is engrossed, enrolled, 
							and presented to the Governor.</p>

							<p><b>Governor's Action.</b> The Governor must 
							either approve a bill or return it with objections 
							to the House of its origin within five days (except
							Sundays) or it becomes law without his signature. 
							(If the Legislature adjourns before the five days 
							have expired, the Governor then has 15 days for 
							consideration of the bill.) When a bill has been 
							vetoed, the objections of the Governor are spread 
							at large upon the Journal, it is reconsidered, 
							and, if two-thirds of those present and voting vote
							in favor of the bill, it is forwarded to the other 
							House. If two-thirds of that House vote in favor of
							its passage over the Governor's veto, the bill then
							becomes a law. The above steps in the passage of a 
							bill are a simplified example of the parliamentary 
							procedure involved in legislation. The process 
							seems very complex, but a knowledge of the rules 
							and procedures and actual experience in observing a
							legislature in action help in understanding that 
							the rules and procedures are to provide thorough 
							study and debate of measures before they become law.
